Make a collection for events
Change events field in Event List to reference Events colleciton

EventList Data Pagination
(These agenda items were dumb. It is very unlikely users will make/save enough lists top crash their page,
and since list pagination was added near the end there is very limited support for it that does not cover these cases well at all.)
    - My Lists
    - Saved Lists
    - User Page Lists
